In this post, I will share with you what I think is the most important apps/tools a software engineer should have, in order to be productive.

### Vim
First and foremost important tool any programmer must have is code editor. I have used variety of the most popular IDEs/editors, such as [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/ide/), [NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) etc. I have to say none of them come close to Vim in terms of programmatically editting code. Vim itself is a programming language, meaning you can customize behaviour, and set it up to fit your needs.

Eventhough I've only been consistently using Vim (recently NeoVim) since 2019, I don't think I will ever come back to any other IDEs, except for Xcode, or Android Studio if I have to build native mobile apps.

### Clipy


### Tmux
There are quite a few Terminal emulators out there that
