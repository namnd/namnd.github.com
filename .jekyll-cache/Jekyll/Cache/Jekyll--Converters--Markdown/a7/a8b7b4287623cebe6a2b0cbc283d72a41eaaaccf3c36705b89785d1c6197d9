I"ª<p>In this post, I will share with you what I think is the most important apps/tools a software engineer should have, in order to be productive.</p>

<h3 id="vim">Vim</h3>
<p>First and foremost important tool any programmer must have is code editor. I have used variety of the most popular IDEs/editors, such as <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ IDEA</a>, <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/ide/">Eclipse</a>, <a href="https://netbeans.apache.org/">NetBeans</a>, <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>, <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> etc. I have to say none of them come close to Vim in terms of programmatically editting code. Vim is a programming language itself, meaning you can write your own (or use otherâ€™s) scripts/plugins to customize behaviour, and set it up to fit your needs.</p>

<p>Eventhough Iâ€™ve only been consistently using Vim (recently NeoVim) since 2019, I donâ€™t think I will ever come back to any other IDEs, except for Xcode, or Android Studio if I have to build native mobile apps.</p>

<h3 id="tmux">Tmux</h3>
<p>There are quite a few Terminal emulators out there that</p>
