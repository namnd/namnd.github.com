I"è<p>In this post, I will share with you what I think is the most important apps/tools a software engineer should have, in order to be productive.</p>

<h3 id="vim">Vim</h3>
<p>First and foremost important tool any programmer must have is code editor. I have used variety of the most popular IDEs/editors, such as <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ IDEA</a>, <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/ide/">Eclipse</a>, <a href="https://netbeans.apache.org/">NetBeans</a>, <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>, <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> etc. I have to say none of them come close to Vim in terms of programmatically editting code. Vim is a programming language itself, meaning you can write your own (or use other‚Äôs) scripts/plugins to customize behaviour to fit your needs.</p>

<p>Eventhough I‚Äôve only been consistently using Vim (recently NeoVim) since 2019, I don‚Äôt think I will ever come back to any other IDEs, except for Xcode, or Android Studio if I have to build native mobile apps.</p>

<h3 id="clipy">Clipy</h3>
<p>One of the most simple but very useful app I use all the time is <a href="https://clipy-app.com/">Clipy</a>. It‚Äôs a Clipboard extension app that support the history of your clipboard. You can configure how many items you want to keep in the history. The only missing feature is ability to fuzzy search for the history. If anyone knows such an app, please leave a comment below. If I manage some time, I might write an app myself cause I‚Äôve been looking but can‚Äôt find a really good one.</p>

<h3 id="tmux">Tmux</h3>
<p>There are quite a few Terminal emulators out there that</p>
