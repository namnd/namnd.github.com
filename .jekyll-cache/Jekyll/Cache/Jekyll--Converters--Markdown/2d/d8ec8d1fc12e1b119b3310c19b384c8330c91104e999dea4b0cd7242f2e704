I"þ<p>In this post, I will share with you what I think is the most important apps/tools a software engineer should have, in order to be productive.</p>

<h3 id="vim">Vim</h3>
<p>First and foremost important tool any programmer must have is code editor.
I have used variety of the most popular IDEs/editors, such as
<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/" target="_blank">IntelliJ IDEA</a>, <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/ide/" target="_blank">Eclipse</a>, <a href="https://netbeans.apache.org/" target="_blank">NetBeans</a>, <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a>, <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> etc. I have to say none of them come close to Vim in terms of programmatically editting code. Vim is a programming language itself, meaning you can write your own (or use otherâ€™s) scripts/plugins to customize behaviour to fit your needs.</p>

<p>Eventhough Iâ€™ve only been consistently using Vim (recently <a href="https://neovim.io/">NeoVim</a>) since 2019, I donâ€™t think I will ever come back to any other IDEs, except for Xcode, or Android Studio if I have to build native mobile apps.</p>

<h3 id="clipy">Clipy</h3>
<p>One of the most simple but very useful app I use all the time is <a href="https://clipy-app.com/">Clipy</a>. 
Itâ€™s a Clipboard extension app that support keeping track the history of your clipboard. 
You can configure as many items as you want to keep in the history. 
The only missing (and frankly quite crucial) feature is the ability to fuzzy search any record in the history. 
If anyone knows such an app, please leave a comment below.
Until then, if I manage some time, I might write an app myself.</p>

<h3 id="tmux">Tmux</h3>
<p>There are quite a few Terminal emulators out there that</p>
